            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Real Madrid in 2009 for a then-world record transfer fee of £80 million was a testament to his burgeoning reputation as one of the world's best. Presented before 80,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabéu, Ronaldo's arrival was seen as a cornerstone of Real Madrid's ambitious "Galacticos" project. His early days were marked by rapid adaptation to La Liga, where he quickly became the focal point of the team's attack.<p>
